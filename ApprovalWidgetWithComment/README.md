# **Simple Approval Widget With Comment**

## Description

**_This contains a service portal approval widget that allows user to add comment to approval record._**

I was looking for approval widget that could allow the users to add comment and noticed the share item 'Approve with a comment'. The share item seems to be using different styling and some additional functionality which I did not require. This widget just follows the same styling of OOB approval info widget and just adds a link to the record being approved and a box for adding comments.

### Installation

- Import the widget found in **dist** folder. The widget is called Approval Info With Comments.
- Add the newly imported widget to the approval or any other service portal page you want.
